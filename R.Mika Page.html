	<h2>Abilities</h2>
	<h3>Passive: Crowd Pleaser</h3>
	<p>Every time R. Mika lands a crowd control ability, she gains a stack of "Hype" up to 5 stacks. Each stack increases her <span class="red">[5%]</span> damage reduction. When she reaches 5 stacks, she gains a <span class="red">[20% MAXHP]</span> shield that absorbs damage for <span class="red">[5]</span> seconds. Hype stacks are lost after <span class="red">[7s]</span> out of combat.</p>
	<h3>Q: Mic Performance</h3>
	<p><span class="light-blue">[90 Mana]</span> <span class="purple">[13s cd]</span></p>

	<h3>R: Rainbow Typhoon [2 charge]</h3>
	<p><span class="light-blue">[70 Mana]</span> <span class="purple">[100s cd/charge]</span></p>
	<p>R. Mika grabs an enemy and she can carry them for <span class="red">[1.5s]</span>. During that, the grabbed enemy can’t act but it is vulnerable. She can’t grab the same enemy within <span class="red">[10s]</span>.</p>
