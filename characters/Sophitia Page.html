            <h2>Abilities</h2>
            <h3>Passive: Divine Blessing</h3>
            <p>Sophitia gains bonuses based on her current HP:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>100-95% HP: +5/15/25/35/45 AD</li>
                <li>94%-80% HP: +3/4/5/8/10 Mana regen/s</li>
                <li>79%-50% HP: Reduces crowd control time by 0.2/0.3/0.35/0.5/0.7 seconds</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Q: Holy Strike</h3>
            <p class="mana"><span class="light-blue">[80 Mana]</span> <span class="cd purple">[10/10/10/9/7s cd]</span></p>
            <p>Sophitia swings her sword twice in front of her. Each hit deals <span class="red">[45/100/165/275/350 + 40% AD]</span> damage. If the target is affected by the bleed from her W ability, Sophitia heals for [50%] of the damage dealt and refreshes the bleed duration.</p>
            <h3>W: Sting</h3>
            <p class="mana"><span class="light-blue">[90 Mana]</span> <span class="cd purple">[15s/13s/10s/9s/9s cd]</span></p>
            <p>Sophitia stabs a nearby enemy with her sword, immediately slowing them by [80%] for [3.5s] and dealing <span class="red">[10/14/20/28/33]</span> damage every [0.5s] during the slow.</p>
            <h3>E: Shield of Faith</h3>
            <p class="mana"><span class="light-blue">[80 Mana]</span> <span class="cd purple">[20/17/17/15/14s cd]</span></p>
            <p>Sophitia increases her movement speed by [20%] and raises her shield in a defensive stance, creating a large protective wall in front of her that absorbs all incoming damage for [3s]. When the wall expires, it sends out a wave that stuns all enemies in front of her for [1.5s]. Expiration can be earlier if the ability is pressed again. During this ability, Sophitia cannot use her Q and W abilities.</p>
            <h3>R: Prayer</h3>
            <p class="mana"><span class="light-blue">[0 Mana]</span> <span class="cd purple">[190/160/140s cd]</span></p>
            <p>Sophitia's HP regeneration increases to <span class="green">[220/350/490]</span> per second for [5s].</p>
