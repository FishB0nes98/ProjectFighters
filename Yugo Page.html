        <h3>Abilities:</h3>
        <h4>Passive: Beast Gauge</h4>
        <p>Yugo has a Beast Gauge that fills up when dealing damage(+3), receiving damage(+7), and killing minions(+1) scoring takedowns(+20). The gauge can be filled to a maximum of 100 points. Transforming into wolf form consumes any points of the gauge, with the duration of the transformation proportional to the amount of the gauge consumed (0.5 seconds per 1 points). Yugo gains 2% lifesteal in human form and 5% lifesteal in wolf form.</p>

        <h4>Q: Crushing Blow (Human) / Savage Claw (Wolf)</h4>
        <p>[0 Mana] [7s/6.5s/6s/5s/4.5s cd]<br>
        Crushing Blow: Yugo punches the target enemy, dealing [60/95/190/270/320] damage and reducing their armor by [15%] for [3] seconds.<br>
        Savage Claw: Yugo bites the target, dealing [95/160/300/400/515 + (10%AD)] damage and applying a bleed that deals [5%AD] over 4 seconds and also reveals the target for the duration.</p>

        <h4>W: Hunter's Speed (Human) / Wolf's Pounce (Wolf)</h4>
        <p>[0 Mana] [12s/10s/9s/8.5s/8s cd]<br>
        Hunter's Speed: Yugo gains [20%] increased movement speed for [3] seconds. If he moves towards enemy champions, the movement speed bonus is increased to [50%].<br>
        Wolf's Pounce: Yugo leaps to a target location, dealing [200%AD] damage and slowing enemies by [30%] for [2] seconds. Biting an enemy reduces the cooldown of this ability by [3] seconds.</p>

        <h4>E: Transform</h4>
        <p>[0 Mana] [No CD, Cost: Beast Gauge]<br>
        Yugo transforms into his wolf form for a duration based on the Beast Gauge consumed. Upon transforming, enemies around him are feared for [0.5/1/1.5/2/2.5] second.</p>

        <h4>R: Beast Rampage</h4>
        <p>[0 Mana] [90s cd]<br>
        Human Form: Yugo goes into a berserk state, gaining [0.5/0.9/1.1] attack speed and [15%] lifesteal for [6] seconds. During this time, he generates double the Beast Gauge points.<br>
        Wolf Form: Yugo unleashes his full power, increasing his attack damage by [150/250/300] and attack speed by [0.5/0.9/1.1] for [6] seconds. Each attack heals him for [15%] of the damage dealt.</p>
