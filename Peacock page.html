	<h2>Abilities</h2>
	<h3>Passive: Big Bang</h3>
	<p>Peacock's autoattacks penetrate the enemy's armor by [35%].</p>
	<h3>Q: Rapid Shots</h3>
	<p><span class="light-blue">[90 mana]</span> <span class="purple">[5s cd]</span></p>
	<p>Peacock fires 3 fixed-target shots in the targeted direction, dealing <span class="red">[50%/55%/70%/90%/100%/125% AD]</span> damage.</p>
	<h3>W: Time Trap</h3>
	<p><span class="light-blue">[30 Mana]</span> <span class="purple">[10s cd]</span></p>
	<p>Peacock throws a trap at the designated nearby location. If an enemy steps on it, they take [200%] increased damage from Peacock and are rooted for [1.2s]. The traps last for [120s].</p>
	<h3>E: Clockwork Clobber</h3>
	<p><span class="light-blue">[90 Mana]</span> <span class="purple">[12s cd]</span></p>
	<p>Peacock swings a hammer in the targeted direction, dealing <span class="red">[50/130/285/395/500/615]</span> damage to hit enemies and knocking them back. If a trap is within the knockback range, enemies automatically fall into it.</p>
	<h3>R: Robodog (2 charge)</h3>
	<p><span class="light-blue">[85 Mana]</span> <span class="purple">[60s cd]</span></p>
	<p>Peacock sends her robotic dog after the designated enemy, which chases them until it makes contact. Upon contact, it stuns the target for [1.5s] and deals <span class="blue">[300/445/600/795]</span> damage. The robotic dog can be destroyed with [3/3/5/5] autoattacks before reaching its target. Only one charge can be used on the same target.</p>
