    <h2>Stats</h2>
    <ul>

        <li><span class="blue">(AP):</span> - (+-/lvl) -> -</li>

        <li><span class="orange">(AS):</span> 0.62 (+0.029/lvl) -> 1.31</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Abilities</h2>
    <h3>Passive: Mark of the Assassin</h3>
    <p>Ibuki's accurate abilities mark the enemy for [6s]. The marked enemy takes a bonus <span class="red">[50%]</span> damage from Ibuki on the next hit. If the marked enemy is below <span class="green">[23% MaxHP]</span>, they take <span class="red">[200%]</span> damage from Ibuki. The mark disappears after taking damage.</p>
    <h3>Q: Kunai Toss</h3>
    <p><span class="light-blue">[0 mana]</span> <span class="purple">[7s/7s/6s/5s/5s cd/charge]</span></p>
    <p>Ibuki throws a Kunai in the targeted direction. Two options are available:</p>
    <p>Click: Short range <span class="red">[75/100/300/385/465/555]</span> damage</p>
    <p>Hold: Long range <span class="red">[105/210/400/615/800]</span> damage</p>
    <h3>W: Shinobi Dash</h3>
    <p><span class="light-blue">[0 Mana]</span> <span class="purple">[0s cd]</span></p>
    <p>Ibuki can jump to an enemy marked by her passive.</p>
    <h3>E: Shadowstep</h3>
    <p><span class="light-blue">[- Mana]</span> <span class="purple">[10s cd/charge]</span> <span class="purple">[2 charge]</span></p>
    <p>After activating the ability, Ibuki becomes invisible for a maximum of [2s] after [0.45s]. If Ibuki deals damage or uses an ability, the invisibility is canceled. In addition, she gains <span class="grey">[+35% MS]</span> during invisibility.</p>
    <h3>R: Sonic Leap</h3>
    <p><span class="light-blue">[- Mana]</span> <span class="purple">[120s cd]</span></p>
    <p>Ibuki leaps onto all enemies she has damaged in the last [8s]. During this time, Ibuki becomes untargetable and continuously dashes. All affected enemies take <span class="red">[555/1225/1400/1805]</span> damage and are marked with her passive again. This ability does not work with passive damage.</p>
