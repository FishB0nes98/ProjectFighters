	<h2>Abilities</h2>
	<h3>Passive: Poisoned Casting</h3>
	<p>Reptile's every hit ability or basic attack deals additional <span class="blue">[80-480]</span> damage over 5 seconds (max 3 stacks).</p>
	<h3>Q: Acid Spit</h3>
	<p><span class="light-blue">[70 mana]</span> <span class="purple">[6s cd]</span></p>
	<p>Reptile spews a large amount of acid in the targeted direction, dealing <span class="blue">[125/230/440/780/930/1225]</span> damage. It creates a pool of acid at the end of the ability's range or behind hit enemies, which slows enemies by <span class="grey">[55%]</span> and triggers the passive.</p>
	<h3>W: Exuviation</h3>
	<p><span class="light-blue">[50 Mana]</span> <span class="purple">[15s cd]</span></p>
	<p>Reptile sheds its slimy skin, removing all crowd control effects, but takes 5% increased damage for [2s].</p>
	<h3>E: Fadeaway</h3>
	<p><span class="purple">[- Mana]</span> <span class="purple">[10s cd]</span></p>

	<h3>R: The Mark of The Lizard</h3>
	<p><span class="light-blue">[100 Mana]</span> <span class="purple">[100s cd]</span> <span class="purple">[1.5s casting time]</span></p>
	<p>Targets an enemy, placing a mark on them for [15s]. While the mark is active, Reptile runs towards them at double speed and deals <span class="blue">[130%/150%/185%]</span> bonus damage.</p>
