	<h1>Morrigan Character Bio</h1>
	<h2>Stats</h2>
	<ul>

		<li><span class="green">HP:</span> 593 (+177/lvl) -> 4841</li>
		<li><span class="light-blue">Mana:</span> 365 (+26/lvl) -> 983</li>

	<h2>Abilities</h2>
	<h3>Passive: Succubus Wrath</h3>
	<p>Morrigan has <span class="yellow">15% Spellvamp</span> from the beginning of the game.</p>
	<h3>Q: Hate Spike</h3>
	<p><span class="light-blue">[40 mana]</span> <span class="purple">[3s cd]</span></p>
	<p>Morrigan summons a spike at the cursor's location on the ground. If it hits an enemy, it deals <span class="blue">[90/160/285/445/530]</span> damage and slows them by <span class="grey">[30%]</span> for (2s). If Morrigan hits the same enemy again within (5s), it deals <span class="blue">[150%]</span> of the ability's base damage, until 5s pass or Morrigan doesn't hit the target again.</p>
	<h3>W: Sharp Shield</h3>
	<p><span class="light-blue">[90 Mana]</span> <span class="purple">[13s cd]</span></p>
	<p>Morrigan places a thorny shield on herself, which explodes after (2s) or if Morrigan is auto-attacked by an enemy. The shield can be canceled by Morrigan (up to 2s). When the shield is destroyed, all nearby enemies take <span class="blue">[100/200/400/800/995]</span> damage and block one basic attack.</p>
	<h3>E: Bat Dash</h3>
	<p><span class="light-blue">[85 Mana]</span> <span class="purple">[12s cd]</span></p>
	<p>Morrigan dashes in the targeted direction. If Morrigan passes through an enemy during the ability, it charms them for (0.6s) and deals <span class="blue">[50/90/155/220/300/400]</span> damage.</p>
	<h3>R: Spike Garden</h3>
	<p><span class="light-blue">[100 Mana]</span> <span class="purple">[110s cd]</span></p>
	<p>Morrigan charms all enemies around her for (1s) and deals <span class="blue">[675/880/1050/1280]</span> damage to them. Already charmed enemies take <span class="blue">[50%]</span> more damage.</p>
